# 🎮 Retro Arcade Shooter (Pyxel)  

## 📜 Overview  
This is my first attempt at developing a game using **Pyxel**. As someone who grew up in the **Atari 2600 era**, I wanted to create a simple yet engaging game that captures the essence of that time—featuring a **retro aesthetic and classic arcade-style gameplay**.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 🕹 **Five Unique Enemy Types** – Each with distinct movement patterns and attack styles.  
- ⚡ **Power-Ups** – Enhance gameplay with:  
  - Increased speed  
  - Different firing styles  
  - A powerful sidekick  
- 🎭 **Boss Battles** – Face off against formidable bosses after reaching a certain score threshold.
